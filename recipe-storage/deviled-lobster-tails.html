    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These spicy lobster tails are so easy to make. Just a note on the lobster tails in supermarkets: if they're not frozen, they've been frozen and then thawed. So, bypass the 'fresh' for the frozen, which are fresher.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped tarragon</li>
        <li>1 tabelspoon sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 frozen lobster tails - thawed, split in half and deveined</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, tarragon, sriracha sauce, paprika, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Set oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. </li>
        <li>Loosen lobster meat from the shell, leaving it attached near the tip of the tail. Place tails on a baking sheet lined with crinkled aluminum foil to help keep them in place. </li>
        <li>Spoon some of the mayonnaise mixture beneath the lobster meat and spread a generous amount on top. </li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until lobster tails are browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
